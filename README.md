# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

## General Thoughts

The travelling salesman problem was something I learnt during my undergrad degree so it was fun trying to crack the np-hard problem that has baffled 
everyone for a long time. I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm which is a greedy algorithm that chooses the shortest path from the origin city in the alloted time.
If I had more time I would have looked in swaping 2 cities and seeing if the overall distance decreases. I overall learnt a lot about vanilla javascript as I am 
mostly familiar with javascript frameworks such as React and Vue and this was a great opportunity to sharpen my vanilla javascript knowledge/skills. I have attached
